# OpenPort  ---- STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ----
An Android port scanning app 

OpenPort is my first project for building an Android app. I took a data assurance class recently and was interested in scanning ports
during the class and the thought of being able to carry around a port scanning device on your phone came into mind. This app is being created with the purpose of solely being used to see what devices are on the local WIFI.

In the future I plan on adding a feature that will send you a notification whenever a new device connects to the network.
